# Future Ready Talent Project by Purushottam Reddy

I have created a website viz "talkToLocals" for people who are likely to explore places. They can find either famous tourist places or hidden nature only known by locals.  My website lets them talk to locals so that they can clear their doubts about any kind of place despite whether it's famous or not. Anyone can talk to verified locals who are willing to help. We connect you to locals through secured connection.My website also recommends must visit places by the reviews given by visitors. About section contains information about the motive of the website. And finally through the contact section anyone can suggest improvements.
